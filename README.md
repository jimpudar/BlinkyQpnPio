# Blinky QP-Nano + PlatformIO Example

This project shows how you can use PlatformIO alongside QP-nano and QM so that
you can have all the benefits of a real hierarchical state machine generator
without sacrificing a modern development environment.

I am using CLion 2025.3 on Windows to create this project, and QM version
5.1.3 which can be found at https://www.state-machine.com/.
